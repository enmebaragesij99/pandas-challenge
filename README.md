# pandas-challenge
My coding along with the two csv files referenced are in the PyCity Schools Folder, along with my written analysis which is in a txt file format.

Once again I did not pull and push my repository through ananconda prompt I did it all manually, so I do hope my code reads the csv file  using the comand I used on my Jupyter notebook (which works for me).

Note; my code may be a bit long, messy (not under the right titles) and at times convoluted only because along the way I figured out how to format the data  the correct way  and I also left formatting til the end and I was told not to completely change dataframes becasue it will make things even harder.

Note; when struggling to find code comands I used stack overflow as a resource and when I was stuck trying to manipulate data in a certain way I asked Learning assistance for some guidance.
