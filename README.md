My coding along with the two csv files referenced are in the PyCity Schools Folder, along with my written analysis which is in a txt file format.

Once again I did not pull and push my repository through ananconda prompt I did it all manually, so I do hope my code reads the csv file  using the comand I used on my Jupyter notebook (which works for me).
