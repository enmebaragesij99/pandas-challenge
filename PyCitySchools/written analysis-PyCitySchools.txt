In this Module 4 Challenge we ananlysed the datasets of schools and their students in a local government area initally as a whole
followed by various increments in relation to schools and student, which included:
-school summary (School Type,Total Students,Total School Budget,Per Student Budget,Average Maths Score, 
Average Reading Score, Passing Maths%, Passing Reading%, % Overall Passing)
-Top and Bottom performing schools (By %Overall Passing)
-Math and Reading scores by Year
-Scores (Average Maths Score, Average Reading Score, Passing Maths%, Passing Reading%, % Overall Passing) 
in terms of school spending(per student)
-Scores in terms of school size(total students)
-Scores in terms of school type

Following this anaylsis the most obvious conclusions that were deduced are:
-Large schools(2000-5000) had noticeably lower passing percentages(maths, reading and overall) 
than smaller schools(small and medium)
-There was no form of positive correlation between more spending per student and higher scores,if anything,
it was quite the opposite as the spending ranges(per student) increased the passing percentages decreased, 
with the spending range of $645-680 having the lowest passing percentages 
-Independent schools had noticeably higher passing percentages in comparison to Governement schools
